    <h1>Hello, I'm Ryan Mohta.<br>
      I'm an aspiring computer scientist from the Bay Area.
    </h1>
    <p>
      My programming journey started with Java in the beginning of seventh grade.
      As the years have passed, I have deepened my understanding of computer science
      and expanded my language skillset to include Java, HTML/CSS/JavaScript, and Swift.
    </p>
    <p>
      I LOVE hackathons! I have been to quite a few hackathons over the last couple
      of years, either as a participant or a mentor. Hackathons are, in my opinion,
      the golden opportunity for programmers to meet each other, work on a project
      together, and have an amazing time. My teams and I have mostly built Android
      apps using Android Studio, although we have also created an iOS app, website,
      and Slack extension.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I am not programming, I really enjoy graphic design, and design apparel,
      promotion pictures, and print material for the Class of 2019 and school clubs.
      I also play the saxophone in my school's marching band, and run distance races
      on our track and field team.
